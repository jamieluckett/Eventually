# What is this?
Eventually is my final year project for a 3 Year Computer Science degree course at the University of Reading in the UK. It is an event managment system written in Python using the Django web-framework. 

## Project Layout

The project follows standard Django file formatting, with the system comprising of 2 custom apps, Event and Account. Event manages the event side of the system, creating and deleting events, responding to invites, etc. Account manages the user account side of the system as well as the analytics and group creation. email_system is a script that needs to be run along side hosting the site in order to have invite emails send out.
